    * The coordinates of the centroid of a triangle are found by averaging the x- and y-coordinates of the vertices.
    * This method will also find the centroid (center of mass) of any set of points on the x-y plane.
    * To find the centroid, follow these steps:
    * Step 1: Identify the coordinates of each vertex.
    * Step 2: Add all the x values from the three vertices coordinates and divide by 3 = 211.4 493.3.
    * Step 3: Add all the y values from the three vertices coordinates and divide by 3 = 407.1 950.

    * Affine transforms is a set of operations that provides for translation and
    * all linear transformations like scale, rotate and shear.
    *
    * The affine transforms scale, rotate and shear can be represented by a matrix
    * multiplication of a point represented as a vector.
    *
    * To be able to represent the translation also as a linear transform it is required
    * to add homogeneous coordinates into the matrices and vector, so they become 3D.
